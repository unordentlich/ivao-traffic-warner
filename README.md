## üßπ Discord Bot Setup

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
2. Navigate to **"Bot"** in the sidebar and click **"Add Bot"**.
3. Choose a nice title and icon for your application :)

4. Under **Installation > Installation Contexts**, set the "User Install" Method Checkbox to checked, the "Guild Install" Checkbox to false (Make also sure the Default Install Settings Scope is set to `applications.commands`)

6. Under **Bot > Token**, copy your bot token and add it to your `config.json`
```js
{
	"DISCORD_TOKEN": "bots_token_goes_here"
}
```

7. Now get the bot's client id at **General Information > Application ID** and add it to your `config.json`
```js
{
	"DISCORD_TOKEN": "bots_token_goes_here",
	"CLIENT_ID": "bots_client_id_goes_here"
}
```
*Note:* You can also use this client ID to get in the direct message chat with your application bot. Therefore, go into a web browser where you're logged in to discord and type in visit `https://discordapp.com/users/@bots_client_id_goes_here`. It will open the bots account so you can get into a DM with it to start using commands.

8. Now we're submitting the application's commands for a one-time registration to discord, so discord knows which commands it can offer for our bot application. Thus, open the temrinal in your project root directory and enter `node commands.js`.

(*Note that this only works if you've set up the config.json correctly before*)

9. Finally you can start the bot by entering `node index.js` in your terminal. The bot should now respond to the commands.

## üì° Data Source

Traffic data is pulled from the official IVAO network using the [Whazzup V2 API](https://wiki.ivao.aero/en/home/devops/api/whazuup/how-to-retrieve-v2). Due to regulations, the update interval is set to 20 seconds. You can change this by updating the `INTERVAL_TIME` const in the index.js file

The `airports.json` data got fetched from the great project [openflights](https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights/blob/master/data/airports.dat) and converted programmatically into a JSON format.
